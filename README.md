This project is the final project from the Coursera IBM class, Machine Learning with Python. We predict the loan status of an individual using four classification algorithms (KNN, Decision Trees, SVM, and Logistic Regression) and then calculate the accuracy of each algorithm to decide which algorthim best predicts loan status.
